`testing.sh` can be run by calling `make test`

This markdown file explains the testing approach taken in `testing.sh`, which runs *unit testing*, *implementation testing*, and *fuzz testing* on the `sudoku.c` module.

## Unit Testing
each module within the sudoku project has its own unit tests which are triggered by defining the ```TESTMODE``` macro when compiling. Each of these unit tests can be ran by calling make test in the respective module

When calling make test outside any subdirectory the Makefile automatically calls make test in each of the module directories, thus running our unit tests. Additionally, calling make test outside any subdirectory will run testing.sh which runs the following implementation and fuzz tests.

## Implementation Testing

The following implementation tests are performed:

1. Ensure each puzzle generated by creator is unique (random)
2. Ensure each puzzle can be solved


# Fuzz Testing

The following process is by default repeated 50 times in order to thoroughly fuzz test the program.

A number in the command line will cause that many iterations of the following:

1. Generate a puzzle using `./sudoku create`, storing it in a test file
2. Generate a second puzzle, storing it in a separate file
3. Determine if differences exist between the two puzzles
4. Solve the first puzzle and print it
5. Solve the second puzzle and solve it

An example run of make test in the main directory can be seen in [testing.out](testing.out)
