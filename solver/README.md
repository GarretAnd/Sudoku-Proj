# CS50 Final Project
## CS50 Spring 2020

### solver

The solver directory stores `solver.c`, which is responsible for solving sudoku puzzles.

`sovler` can perform the following tasks:

1. Solve a puzzle
2. State if a puzzle has one unique solution or not

### Usage

`solver.c` is meant to be called by outside modules, and thus does not have an exectuable.

### Assumptions

No assumptions were made beyond those that were clear from the spec.

### Compilation

To compile, call `make`. To clean, call `make clean`.
